    "# Credit Card Fraud Detection Challenge at Silverleaf National Bank\n",
    "\n",
    "## The Situation\n",
    "It's 9:15 AM at Silverleaf National Bank's headquarters. You've just left an emergency meeting where the Head of Security revealed alarming statistics: a 47% increase in credit card fraud cases over the last quarter, resulting in $2.3 million in losses. The CEO has given your team 48 hours to develop a solution.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Your Mission\n",
    "As the lead data scientist, you must develop a machine learning model to detect fraudulent transactions in real-time. You have access to a historical dataset of 100,000 transactions, each labeled as fraudulent or legitimate.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Time Allocation (2 hours total):\n",
    "- EDA & Visualization: 40 minutes\n",
    "- Data Preprocessing: 20 minutes\n",
    "- Model Building & Evaluation: 40 minutes\n",
    "- Making & Saving Predictions: 20 minutes\n",
    "\n",
    "## Grading:\n",
    "- EDA (25 points)\n",
    "- Data Preprocessing (25 points)\n",
    "- Model Building & Evaluation (25 points)\n",
    "- Test Predictions (25 points)\n",
    "- Bonus Points (10 points)\n",
