        "Dataset available on [Kaggle: Starbucks Customer Data](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/ihormuliar/starbucks-customer-data)\n",
        "\n",
        "## Business Context\n",
        "Starbucks regularly sends out promotional offers to their customers through various channels (email, mobile, web, social media). These offers can be drink advertisements, discounts, or buy-one-get-one-free (BOGO) deals. Not all customers receive the same offer, and not all offers are equally effective. Understanding offer effectiveness and customer behavior can significantly impact business success.\n",
        "\n",
        "## Project Objective\n",
        "Analyze the Starbucks promotional offers dataset to derive actionable insights about customer behavior and offer effectiveness. Some potential areas to explore (but not limited to):\n",
        "\n",
        "### Possible Analysis Directions\n",
        "1. Offer Performance Analysis\n",
        "   - Which types of offers are most successful?\n",
        "   - How does offer success vary across different customer segments?\n",
        "   - What is the optimal duration for different types of offers?\n",
        "\n",
        "2. Customer Segmentation\n",
        "   - Can we identify distinct customer groups based on their response to offers?\n",

        "   - Which customer segments are most valuable to target?\n",
        "\n",
        "3. Channel Effectiveness\n",
        "   - Which communication channels are most effective for different customer segments?\n",
        "   - Does multi-channel marketing improve offer success?\n",
        "\n",
        "4. Customer Behavior Patterns\n",
        "   - What is the typical customer journey from receiving to completing an offer?\n",
        "   - Are there patterns in transaction behavior with and without offers?\n",
        "   - How does membership tenure relate to offer response?\n",
        "\n",
        "## Technical Requirements\n",
        "Your analysis should include:\n",
        "1. Data Cleaning & Preprocessing\n",
